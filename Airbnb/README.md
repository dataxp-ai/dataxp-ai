### Top Tips

Take time to ask questions and really interogate the problem. What might investors be interested in? Why would they want to know this information? How can we provide value to the customer?

Remember: garbage in, garbage out! Make sure your data is clean before putting the hard yards in with data analysis and visualisation.

Keep an MVP (minimum viable product) mentality. Start small, build a functioning prototype on a small amout of data, then iterate!

Make sure your data visualisation tells a story. Try to keep in mind the question you're trying to answer.
